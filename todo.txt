# Todo List (*react.js)*: Project Prompt

Our goal is to create a To Do List UI. This UI will have three main components:

- **Header** that labels the To Do list. This is just a basic application identifier
- A **list** to display each to do item.
- A **form** that adds a To Do task item to the list. The default complete should be set to `false`.

For our list, there are two additional capabilities that we need to create:

- Give the ability to *toggle on and off* a striket-hrough that indicates completion. When I click on an incomplete "do", its status will be set as completed and it will be strike-through. Likewise, when I click on a completed task, its status will be set as not completed and the strike-through it will be deleted.
- At the bottom of the list will be a component that will prompt the user to *delete the completed tasks*. This can be a button or some other kind of call-to-action. Will delete all completed "do" in the list.

Example design (it doesn't have to be the same as the design);

"JSX" should be used when creating **react** elements. (A syntax extension of JavaScript)

After the Todo List app is completed, we want it to be deployed in "**Heroku**" platform using "**webpack with react**".
